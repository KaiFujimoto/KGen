The defining features of Alzheimer disease include conspicuous changes in both brain histology and behavior.
The The defining features of Alzheimer disease brain is characterized microscopically by the combined presence of 2 classes of abnormal structures, extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, both of which comprise highly insoluble, densely packed filaments.
The soluble building blocks of abnormal structures, extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles are Amyloid-Beta peptides for plaques and tau for tangles.
Amyloid-Beta peptides are proteolytic fragments of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein, whereas tau is a brain-specific, axon-enriched microtubule-associated protein.
The behavioral symptoms of The defining features of Alzheimer disease correlate with the accumulation of plaques and tangles, and Amyloid-Beta peptides are a direct consequence of the damage and destruction of synapses that mediate memory and cognition.
Synapse loss can be caused by the failure of live neurons to maintain functional axons and dendrites or by neuron death.
During the past dozen years, a steadily accumulating body of evidence has indicated that soluble forms of both Amyloid-Beta and tau work together, independently of soluble forms of Amyloid-Beta and tau work together accumulation into plaques and tangles, to drive healthy neurons into the diseased state and that hallmark toxic properties of both Amyloid-Beta require tau.
For instance, acute neuron death, delayed neuron death following ectopic cell cycle reentry, and synaptic dysfunction are triggered by soluble, extracellular both Amyloid-Beta species and depend on soluble, cytoplasmic tau.
Therefore, both Amyloid-Beta is upstream of tau in The defining features of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis and triggers the conversion of tau from a normal to a toxic state, but there is also evidence that toxic tau enhances both Amyloid-Beta toxicity via a feedback loop.
Because soluble toxic aggregates of both both Amyloid-Beta and tau can self-propagate and spread throughout the brain by prionlike mechanisms, successful therapeutic intervention for The defining features of Alzheimer disease would benefit from detecting soluble, extracellular Amyloid-Beta species before plaques, tangles, and cognitive impairment become evident and from interfering with the destructive biochemical pathways that soluble, extracellular Amyloid-Beta species initiate.
