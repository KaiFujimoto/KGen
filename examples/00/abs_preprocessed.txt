A series of 3-amino-substituted rutacecarpine derivatives were synthesized to identify novel multitarget-directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Biological evaluation showed that most of the synthesized compounds inhibited butyrylcholinesterase and exerted antioxidant effects.
Among the synthesized compounds, 6n was subjected to further biological evaluation.
Lineweaver-Burk plotting illustrated that 6n bound simultaneously to the peripheral anionic site and catalytic sites of butyrylcholinesterase.
molecular modeling illustrated that 6n bound simultaneously to the peripheral anionic site and catalytic sites of butyrylcholinesterase.
Furthermore, 6n modulated amyloid-beta aggregation; chelated biometals; presented good absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties; and showed remarkable neuroprotective activity.
Previous research has shown that the optimized compound 6n has considerable potential for development as an novel multitarget-directed ligand for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
